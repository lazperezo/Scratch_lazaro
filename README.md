Introduction:
Welcome to Explore Hippocampal Neurogenesis, a Scratch project designed to help you understand how different conditions affect hippocampal neurogenesis. 
Neurogenesis is the process of generating new brain neurons. This project allows you to explore the impact of sedentary and exercise conditions on this process.

Educational Information:
Neurogenesis is a fascinating process that occurs in the hippocampal dentate gyrus. The hippocampus is a vital brain region responsible for memory and learning. 
By engaging with this simulation, you can gain insights into how physical activity and a sedentary lifestyle influence the growth of new neurons, potentially impacting cognitive functions. Note the temporary effect of exercise over the increment of neurogenesis (roughly 30 days).
